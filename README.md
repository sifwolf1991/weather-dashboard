## 5. Usage

-	You can retrieve weather forecasts through a fetch request to the OpenWeatherMap ‘One call’ API which gives you daily forecast data.
-	The simple form design interface allows you to make a search of cities around the world and receive data on daily temperature, humidity, and wind speed readings.
-	You can return to the page to view saved search information, or delete your search history using the simple colour coded button layout.
-	The button has a ‘3D’ graphic design that has the effect of appearing to be pressed down, which enhances the interactivity.

## 11. Project status

There's currently an issue with the lat/lon part of the the API code, so searching for cities with the same name, such as Melbourne will return results outside Australia.
